## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Voting / probability aggregation in Ensemble classes
- predict_proba method in Classifier
- predict_proba method in BoostAODE
- predict_voting parameter in BoostAODE constructor to use voting or probability to predict (default is voting)
- hyperparameter predict_voting to AODE, AODELd and BoostAODE (Ensemble child classes)
- tests to check predict & predict_proba coherence

## [1.0.2] - 2024-02-20

### Fixed

- Fix bug in BoostAODE: do not include the model if epsilon sub t is greater than 0.5
- Fix bug in BoostAODE: compare accuracy with previous accuracy instead of the first of the ensemble if convergence true

## [1.0.1] - 2024-02-12

### Added

- Notes in Classifier class
- BoostAODE: Add note with used features in initialization with feature selection
- BoostAODE: Add note with the number of models
- BoostAODE: Add note with the number of features used to create models if not all features are used
- Test version number in TestBayesModels
- Add tests with feature_select and notes on BoostAODE

### Fixed

- Network predict test
- Network predict_proba test
- Network score test
